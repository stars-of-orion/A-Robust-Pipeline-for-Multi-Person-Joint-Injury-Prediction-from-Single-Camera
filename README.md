## The files of this repo is protected by a password which is the paper ID starts with:  ai-40***

This folder contains all files used to generate the dataset, build the
view classification models, and test the posture assessment pipeline.
The content of each folder is described below.
---
## 1. COCO_annotations_JSONs This folder contains the two COCO
keypoints annotation files used to generate the full dataset of more
than 230K keypoint records. These files were downloaded from the
following Kaggle dataset:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/awsaf49/coco-2017-dataset
Files included: - person_keypoints_train2017.json  -
person_keypoints_val2017.json
Both files were used to extract the COCO keypoints and to create the
final CSV dataset.

## 2. code This folder contains the Jupyter notebooks used in the project:
1. **PoseAssessmentPipeline.ipynb** This notebook runs the posture assessment pipeline, including view prediction (using models or rules), angle calculations, and posture classification.
2. **View Classification model bulding.ipynb** This notebook is used to train the view classification models (Random Forest and XGBoost), perform preprocessing, tune hyperparameters, and save the trained models.
---
## 3. PKL This folder contains the trained model files generated by the view classification notebook:
- **random_forest_adjusted_sideRules.pkl**  - **scaler.pkl**  -
**xgboost_config7.pkl**
  
These files are serialized and used to load the trained models and the fitted scaler for view prediction.
---
## 4. COCOAnnot_270KDataset.csv.

This CSV file contains the full processed dataset (over 270K rows) generated from the two COCO annotation JSON files. It includes all 17 COCO keypoints (x and y coordinates), with the visibility flag removed after processing, and
each row is labeled with the final view class assigned using the project's rule-based method.
---
## 5. Danger dataset testing This folder contains a Unity-generated dataset used for testing failure cases. It includes synthetic sequences for **LeftKnee** and **LeftElbow** flexions, starting from a neutral position (0°) up to abnormal angles where the Human Pose
Estimation model fails to estimate the posture correctly.
